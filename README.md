# XIOT_Assignment
The solution for the assignment of XIOT to enter the internship programme
*Write c or arduino function to control one input and output (IO Pins) the input pin is a switch as interrupt once it pressed it should lighting the 
led connected to output pin.
*if the switch pressed must send “pressed” to the serial monitor only one time also send the LED states ”ON” or “OFF”
*the whole function could be used many times in the program without interfering each-other
*Your program can send continuous serial date comes from temperature sensor with 3 second rate .at the same time
*No Assumptions
